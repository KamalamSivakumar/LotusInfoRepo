Building a rule-based chatbot on information regarding lotuses. 
Have used the nltk library.

The article text is taken from Wikipedia and a blog on the internet: 

[\"https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/lotus-flower-meaning#:~:text=Lotus%20flowers%20have%20a%20long,as%20folklore%20in%20ancient%20Greece.\",
\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelumbo_nucifera\"]

This project aims to use the various similarity measures and learn how to build chatbots.
The next step would be to develop a conversational-ai or a rag, instead of giving replies based on similarity measures, the model will come up with its answers.
